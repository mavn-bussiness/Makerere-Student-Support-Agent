Install the project dependencies and run the strict source downloader:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.core.download_mak_policies

Policy files are stored under `knowledge/raw/mak-policies/`. The downloader
also writes `knowledge/mak-policies-manifest.csv` and records each downloaded
document in `knowledge/source_register.json` with its official source URL.
